# *Enchiridion of Epictetus*

I used to have a very small French edition of Epictetus' handbook. I miss him quite a lot as it's kind of a spell book for living.

I guess future generations won't care that much about small books or ancient philosophy but if they do, may they also have Stoics' wisdom in their pocket (if they still have hands and still have compact devices with internet access ðŸ¤–) in a nice and readable way as I used to have.
